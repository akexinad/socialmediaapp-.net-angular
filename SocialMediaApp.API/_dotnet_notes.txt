NOTES ON LOGGING INFO.

- The appsettings.development.json file determines what gets logged to your terminal when your in development and  appsettings.json determines what is logged in other environments.




DATABASE NOTES.

- We are going to take the "Code First" approach.
    - This means that we create our class models, that represent the objects that directly relate to tables in our database.





ENTITYFRAMEWORK NOTES:

- When you create a Model/Entity, you need to let EntityFramework know bout its existence.
- This happens in the DataContext file.

- Then your application needs to know about this DataContext.
- This happens in our Startup.cs file.

- Use the nugetpackage manager to install sqlite.
- ctrl shift P > nuget package manager: add package > Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite > pick the latest version.
- It should be added to your .csproj file.
