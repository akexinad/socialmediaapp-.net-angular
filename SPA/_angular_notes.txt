HTTP REQUESTS

- Http requests retun an observable, and to access the observable, we need to subscribe to the request.



NG ONINIT ()

- This function happens after the constreuctor is invoked and when the component is initialized.

- So the constructor makes HttpClient available.
- We write the logic to get the values.
- We then pass the getValues() function in ngOninit() so the function is invoked




CORS

- Cross-Origin-Resdource-Sharing.
- CORS controls which client is allowed to access our API.
- These are managed in the backend. See dotnet notes.
