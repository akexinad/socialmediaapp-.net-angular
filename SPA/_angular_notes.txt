HTTP REQUESTS
=============

- Http requests retun an observable, and to access the observable, we need to subscribe to the request.



NG ONINIT ()
============

- This function happens after the constructor is invoked and when the component is initialized.

- So the constructor makes HttpClient available.
- We write the logic to get the values.
- We then pass the getValues() function in ngOninit() so the function is invoked




CORS
====

- Cross-Origin-Resdource-Sharing.
- CORS controls which client is allowed to access our API.
- These are managed in the backend. See dotnet notes.




PARENT TO CHILD COMPONENT COMMUNICATION
=======================================

- This link is made inside the html files inside the child-component element like so:
    - <child-component [dataFromParent]="dataVariableName" ></child-component>
- You can name the data whatever you like in the square brackets.
- Then in the child component ts, you add an @Input decorator:
    - @Input() dataFromParent: type;
- Now you can display that data in the child html component using the dataFromParent variable name.
