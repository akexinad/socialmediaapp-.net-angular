HTTP REQUESTS
=============

- Http requests retun an observable, and to access the observable, we need to subscribe to the request.



NG ONINIT ()
============

- This function happens after the constructor is invoked and when the component is initialized.

- So the constructor makes HttpClient available.
- We write the logic to get the values.
- We then pass the getValues() function in ngOninit() so the function is invoked




CORS
====

- Cross-Origin-Resdource-Sharing.
- CORS controls which client is allowed to access our API.
- These are managed in the backend. See dotnet notes.




PARENT TO CHILD COMPONENT COMMUNICATION
=======================================

- This link is made inside the html files inside the child-component element like so:
    - <child-component [dataFromParent]="dataVariableName" ></child-component>
- You can name the data whatever you like in the square brackets.
- Then in the child component ts, you add an @Input decorator:
    - @Input() dataFromParent: type;
- Now you can display that data in the child html component using the dataFromParent variable name.




CHILD TO PARENT COMPONENT COMMUNICATION
=======================================

- Child components emit events and this form of communication assigns the event emitter the @Output decorator.
    - @Output(): variableName = new EventEmitter();
- Then we emit the event in the corresponding method:
    - childComponentMethod() {
        this.variableName.emit(whateverYouWantToEmit);
    }
- Then we go to the parent component html, and inside the child component element we use normal brackets to link the data:
    - <child-component  
        [dataFromParent]="dataVariableName"
        (variableName)="newVariableMethodName( $event )" 
    ></child-component>
- Create a method in the parent ts component:
    - newVariableMethodName( arg: type ) {
        // Insert logic here
    }




IMPORTING NPM PACKAGES THAT REQUIRE CSS STYLING
===============================================

- When importing packages that require styling, you might need to import some files into the styles.css and angular.json [see the scripts property] files from the npm package itself.




CREATING GUARDS
===============

- Inside the _guards folder we have an angular guard that protects from unauthorized users being able to access certain routes of the application by just typing the route address.
- Guards can be generated using the angular cli:
    ng g guard fileName' --options
